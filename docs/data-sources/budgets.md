# doit_budgets (Data Source)

Track actual cloud spend against planned spend.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# List all budgets
data "doit_budgets" "all" {}

# Output total number of budgets
output "total_budgets" {
  value = data.doit_budgets.all.row_count
}

# Output budget names
output "budget_names" {
  value = [for b in data.doit_budgets.all.budgets : b.budget_name]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (String) An expression for filtering the results of the request. The syntax is "key:[<value>]".
Available keys: owner, lastModified in ms (>lasModified). Multiple filters can be connected using a pipe |. Note that using different keys in the same filter results in "AND," while using the same key multiple times in the same filter results in "OR".
- `max_creation_time` (String) Max value for reports creation time, in milliseconds since the POSIX epoch. If set, only reports created before or at this timestamp are returned.
- `max_results` (String) The maximum number of results to return in a single page. Leverage the page tokens to iterate through the entire collection.
- `min_creation_time` (String) Min value for reports creation time, in milliseconds since the POSIX epoch. If set, only reports created after or at this timestamp are returned.
- `page_token` (String) Page token, returned by a previous call, to request the next page of results
