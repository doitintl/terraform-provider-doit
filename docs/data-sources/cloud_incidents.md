# doit_cloud_incidents (Data Source)

Service disruptions and outages from cloud providers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# List recent cloud incidents (max_results recommended to avoid long fetch times)
data "doit_cloud_incidents" "recent" {
  max_results = 100
}

# Filter cloud incidents by platform
data "doit_cloud_incidents" "gcp_only" {
  max_results = 50
  filter      = "platform:google-cloud"
}

output "incident_count" {
  value = data.doit_cloud_incidents.recent.row_count
}

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Combining data sources: filter incidents and enrich with platform info
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Use doit_platforms to discover valid platform identifiers for filtering
data "doit_platforms" "all" {}

output "available_platforms_for_incidents" {
  description = "Platform IDs that can be used in cloud incident filters (e.g., filter = \"platform:<id>\")"
  value       = [for p in data.doit_platforms.all.platforms : { id = p.id, name = p.display_name }]
}

# Use doit_products to cross-reference incident products with known services
data "doit_products" "gcp" {
  platform = "google_cloud_platform"
}

locals {
  gcp_product_names = [for p in data.doit_products.gcp.products : p.display_name]
}

# Group GCP incidents by product and show which ones match known products
output "gcp_incidents_by_product" {
  description = "GCP incidents enriched with product matching"
  value = [for i in data.doit_cloud_incidents.gcp_only.incidents : {
    id      = i.id
    title   = i.title
    product = i.product
    status  = i.status
    # Check if this incident's product matches a known GCP product
    known_product = contains(local.gcp_product_names, i.product)
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (String) An expression for filtering the results. The syntax is `key:[<value>]`. Multiple filters can be connected using a pipe |. See [Filters](https://developer.doit.com/docs/filters).
- `max_creation_time` (String) Max value for the cloud incident creation time, in milliseconds since the POSIX epoch. If set, only cloud incidents created before or at this
timestamp are returned.
- `max_results` (Number) The maximum number of results to return in a single page. Leverage the page tokens to iterate through the entire collection.
- `min_creation_time` (String) Min value for the cloud incident creation time, in milliseconds since the POSIX epoch. If set, only cloud incidents created after or at this timestamp are returned.
- `page_token` (String) Page token, returned by a previous call, to request the next page of results

### Read-Only

- `incidents` (Attributes List) Array of cloud incidents (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--incidents))
- `row_count` (Number) Cloud incidents rows count

<a id="nestedatt--incidents"></a>
### Nested Schema for `incidents`

Read-Only:

- `create_time` (Number) The creation time of this cloud incident, in milliseconds since the epoch.
- `id` (String) The unique cloud incident identifier.
- `platform` (String) The Cloud Platform.
- `product` (String) The name of the product affected by the cloud incident
- `status` (String) The Status of the issue
- `title` (String) Cloud incident name as provided by the cloud platform vendor
