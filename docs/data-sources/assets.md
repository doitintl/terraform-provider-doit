## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (String) An expression for filtering the results of the request. The syntax
is `key:[<value>]`. e.g: "type:g-suite". Multiple filters can be
connected using a pipe |. Note that using different keys in the same
filter results in “AND,” while using the same key multiple times in
the same filter results in “OR”.
- `max_results` (Number) The maximum number of results to return in a single page. Leverage the page tokens to iterate through the entire collection.
- `page_token` (String) Page token, returned by a previous call, to request the next page of results

### Read-Only

- `assets` (Attributes List) Array of Assets (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assets))
- `row_count` (Number) Assets rows count

<a id="nestedatt--assets"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assets`

Read-Only:

- `create_time` (Number) The time when the asset was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.
- `id` (String)
- `name` (String)
- `quantity` (Number)
